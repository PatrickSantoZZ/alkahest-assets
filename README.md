This repository holds large binary assets for **Alkahest**, such as data center
files. They are stored in the form of releases on the GitHub page.

Users will never need to download anything manually from this repository; the
Alkahest command line interface will handle that.

The [manifest.json](manifest.json) file contains a list of assets along with
checksums for various hash algorithms. See
[manifest.schema.json](manifest.schema.json) for how to interpret the file.

Please do not send pull requests. This repository is maintained by the core
developers.
